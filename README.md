# Data Analysis of the churn rate for Waze Navigation App

### Hi, Kelly here. I worked as business analyst for more than 2 years, but later paused for certain reason. 
### To pickup all the analytical skills, i took Google advanced data analytics certificate course from Cousera. Here is the link: Desktop/GoogleAdvancedDataAnalyticsCertificate.pdf

The project attached above is to demo my skills on Python packages using, like Panda, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, etc. to do data cleaning, exploratory analysis, hypotheses testing, regression model building and evaluation, etc., but more important is to apply the best working method PACE(Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) along the way.
