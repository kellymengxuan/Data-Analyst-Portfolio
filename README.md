# Data Analysis portfolio 

## 1. Analytical method and Python skills -- Analysis of the churn rate for Waze Navigation App

Hi, Kelly here. I worked as business analyst for more than 2 years, but paused for few years because of motherhood and relocation to Singapore.

To reinforce all the analytical skills, I have taken Google advanced data analytics certificate course from Cousera. Here is the link for certificate check: [Desktop/GoogleAdvancedDataAnalyticsCertificate.pdf](https://github.com/kellymengxuan/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Desktop/GoogleAdvancedDataAnalyticsCertificate.pdf)

## The project attached above is to demonstrate my skills on Python packages using, like Panda, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn to do data cleaning, exploratory analysis, hypotheses testing, and regression model building/evaluation, etc., but more important is to apply the best working method PACE(Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) along the process of analysis to make sure everything is accurate.
